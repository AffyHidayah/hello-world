# hello-world

Hi everyone.. My name is Fiqah and im 22.. 
Im a student of Information Management in Uitm Samarahan..

This is my last semester for my Diploma..
But it is abit challenging when all the classes have to be change into online form due to Covid-19
The minister of Malaysia has been given an order to everone who lived in Malaysia to "stay at home"
We are strictly not allowed to go out from home..actually, it is good for me because im not willing to go out eveyday..
There are alot of things that i've done throughout this MCO..

First, I spend some of my time in the kitchen to try a new recipe and impove my cooking skills..
It was a great satisfaction when my partner became a food tester for every dish I cooked and he liked it .. (because I cook his favorite food)
